# parallax-3d-lens-effect

The demonstration how to create 3D lens parallax effect when moving mouse using CSS `transform`.

The parallax effect only uses JavaScript to pass mouse coordinates into CSS variables.
The background "rain effect" is created with canvas and animated using JavaScript.

To generate static HTML with assets from their source files is used the [html-bundler-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webdiscus/html-bundler-webpack-plugin).

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="docs/images/parallax-3d-lens-effect.gif" alt="Parallax 3D lens effect demo">
</div>

> This example uses the assets created by @agragregra WebDesign Master.
